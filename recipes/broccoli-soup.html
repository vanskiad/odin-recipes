        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A smooth, blended vegetable soup with blue cheese that's as good for a comforting meal as it is for a dinner party starter.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
            <li>1 stick celery, sliced</li>
            <li>1 leek, sliced</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium potato, diced</li>
            <li>1 knob butter</li>
            <li>1l low salt or homemade chicken or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>1 head broccoli, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>140g stilton, or other blue cheese, crumbled</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tbsp rapeseed oil in a large saucepan and then add 1 finely chopped onion. Cook on a medium heat until soft. Add a splash of water if the onion starts to catch.</li>
            <li>Add 1 sliced celery stick, 1 sliced leek, 1 diced medium potato and a knob of butter. Stir until melted, then cover with a lid. Allow to sweat for 5 minutes then remove the lid.</li>
            <li>Pour in 1l of chicken or vegetable stock and add any chunky bits of stalk from 1 head of broccoli. Cook for 10-15 minutes until all the vegetables are soft.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the roughly chopped broccoli and cook for a further 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer to a blender and blitz until smooth.</li>
            <li>Stir in 140g crumbled stilton, allowing a few lumps to remain. Season with black pepper and serve.</li>

        </ol>
