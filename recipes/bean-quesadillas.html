        <h2>Description</h2>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
            <li>400g can pinto or kidney beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>8 flour tortillas</li>
            <li>100g cheddar or gruyère, coarsely grated</li>
            <li>handful coriander leaves</li>
            <li>200g tub fresh tomato salsa, plus extra to serve</li>
            <li>soured cream, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan and cook the onion and garlic for 2 mins. Add the cumin and cook for 1 min more. Tip in the beans, paprika and a splash of water. Using a potato masher, break the beans down as they warm through to make a rough purée. Season generously.</li>
            <li>Spread the refried beans onto 4 of the tortillas and scatter over the cheese and coriander. Spoon over the salsa, then top with the remaining tortillas to make 4 sandwiches. Wipe the frying pan with kitchen paper and return to the heat or heat a griddle pan. Cook each sandwich for 1-2 mins on each side until the tortillas are crisp and golden and the cheese is melting. Serve warm, cut into wedges, with extra salsa and soured cream for dipping.</li>
